  <p> I am currently a joint PhD student at the University of Groningen and University of Copenhagen. I am also part of the Marie Curie Innovative Training Network, CHAMELEON. During my PhD, I will model the evolution of a protoplanetary disk into exoplanets. I hope to establish a link between the processes of planet formation to exoplanet composition.

    Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the Interstellar and Heliospheric Physics group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I hold a Master's in Physics from California State University, Northridge. My previous research focused on disentangling the effects of thermal instabilities from those caused by planets in older circumstellar disks as well as the vortices in disks and their effect on disk chemistry. <br><br>
