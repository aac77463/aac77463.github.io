  <p> I am an astrophysicist currently working as a Research Assistant in the Interstellar and Heliospheric Physics group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I recently finished my Master's in Physics at California State University, Northridge. My ongoing research focuses on disentangling the effects of thermal instabilities from those caused by planets in older circumstellar disks as well as the vortices in disks and their effect on disk chemistry. <br><br>

  Starting October 1st, I will be starting a Ph.D. program at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen, Netherlands. There, I will be investigating the effect that various planet formation scenarios have on the final composition of exoplanet atmospheres.</p>
