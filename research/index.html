			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>My research focuses on debris disks, which are older second generation disks around other stars. These disks, at times, show structures that are usually attributed to exoplanets. My research focuses on thermal instabilities, mainly the photoelectric instability, which can result in the same structures that are usually attributed to other processes.</p>
